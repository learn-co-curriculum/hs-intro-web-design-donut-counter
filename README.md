Build a donut counting app to make sure there are enough donuts for your guests. Never again will you endure sleepless nights worrying if you have enough donuts on hand for your hungry friends, or that Homer ate them all while you slept.

## Get To Work

You'll be coding your solution in `js/donut.js`. You'll want to have `index.html` open in the browser to test your code.

+ **Step One:** Declare 2 variables one for guests and one for donuts

+ **Step Two:** Use prompt method to bring up a dialog box in the browser for the user to insert the number of guests and donuts and store the values in the variables you created.

+ **Step Three:** Use parseInt to convert the users answer from a string to an integer.

+ **Step Four:** Write a conditional to check if there are enough donuts

+ **Step Five:** alert the user with a message telling them the numbers of donuts and guests, and if there are enough donuts for each guest.
